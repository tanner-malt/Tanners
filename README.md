This is my site, designed with minimal css and hugo static site generator. Eventually will be moving the host to a free source, and revamping the blog to include a professional and personal section. 

Currently, the site is broken and I have no idea why! Well I have a general idea, I deleted a lot of stuff, but that's okay, I'll fix it after Maltifect is running.

Speaking of Maltifect, it's my company I started at www.maltifect.com
