# Security Workflow and Measures Overview

This document outlines the security policies, implemented measures, and best practices for the project.

## 1. Security Policy (`SECURITY.md`)

The `SECURITY.md` file serves as the primary policy document and includes:

*   **Supported Versions:** Details which versions of the project receive security updates (currently 1.0.x).
*   **Reporting a Vulnerability:** Provides contact information (tanner@tanner-mcgrath.me) and a detailed list of information required when submitting a vulnerability report.
*   **Stated Security Measures (Policy):** The policy lists several security measures the project *aims* to implement. The sections below will detail the observed implementation status of these.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
    *   HTTPS enforcement
    *   XSS protection
    *   CSRF protection
    *   Rate limiting
    *   Input sanitization
    *   Secure logging practices
    *   Regular dependency updates
    *   Automated security scanning
*   **Stated Best Practices (Policy):** Outlines security best practices for contributors, including:
    *   Never committing sensitive data.
    *   Using environment variables for configuration.
    *   Sanitizing all user input.
    *   Following the principle of least privilege.
    *   Keeping dependencies up to date.
    *   Writing secure code and including security tests.

## 2. Implemented Security Measures & Configurations

This section details security measures observed in the codebase and configuration files.

*   **HTTPS Enforcement:**
    *   The deployment workflows on IONOS (e.g., `Tanners-orchestration.yaml` passing `site-url: https://IONOS_DEPLOY_NOW_SITE_URL`) suggest that the deployed site is intended to be served over HTTPS. The actual enforcement (e.g., HSTS headers, HTTP to HTTPS redirects) would typically be configured at the IONOS hosting level or via a more comprehensive `.htaccess` if an Apache server were directly managing this with such rules.
*   **Input Sanitization (in Logging):**
    *   `server/logger.js`: Implements a `sanitizeData` function that redacts sensitive fields (e.g., 'password', 'token', 'key', 'secret', 'authorization') from log metadata before they are written to logs. This is a good practice for secure logging.
*   **Secure Logging Practices:**
    *   The use of Winston in `server/logger.js` with features like log rotation and potential for different log levels contributes to secure logging.
    *   Data sanitization (mentioned above) is a key part of this.
*   **Dependency Management & Updates:**
    *   `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are used for Node.js dependency management. Regular updates should be performed manually (e.g., `npm update`) or using automated tools like GitHub's Dependabot (no explicit Dependabot configuration was observed in `.github/`).
*   **Automated Testing (Indirect Security Benefit):**
    *   The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs unit and integration tests, which can help catch regressions that might inadvertently introduce security issues.
*   **`.htaccess` Configuration (Current Version):**
    *   The currently reviewed version of `.htaccess` is:
        ```
        Options +Indexes
        Require all granted
        DirectoryIndex index.html
        ```
    *   This configuration primarily enables directory indexing (`Options +Indexes`) and ensures files are served. It **does not contain** security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, or HTTPS redirection rules that might have been present or expected from earlier observations or common security hardening practices for Apache.
    *   **Note:** If a previous version of `.htaccess` contained more extensive security headers, its absence now is a significant change and potential regression in security posture if those headers were intended for the live environment and if an Apache server is in use.

## 3. Security Measures Mentioned in Policy but Not Directly Observed in Current Code Review:

This highlights areas from `SECURITY.md` where direct implementation details were not found during this specific review pass. They might be handled at the hosting provider level (IONOS), through unreviewed configuration files (e.g., `.deploy-now/Tanners/config.yaml`), or may represent areas for future implementation.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers:** Not present in the current `.htaccess` file. Could be set by IONOS.
*   **XSS Protection Headers:** (e.g., `X-XSS-Protection`). Not present in the current `.htaccess`.
*   **CSRF Protection:** No specific CSRF tokens or middleware observed in the reviewed Node.js setup (would be relevant if the server handles form submissions or state-changing requests).
*   **Rate Limiting:** No specific rate-limiting middleware or configuration observed for the Node.js server. Could be a feature of IONOS.
*   **Automated Security Scanning:** No explicit configuration for tools like Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security code/secret scanning (beyond what GitHub provides by default) was observed in the workflows.

## 4. Environment Variables & Sensitive Data

*   **GitHub Secrets:** The GitHub Actions workflows (`Tanners-orchestration.yaml`, `deploy-to-ionos.yaml`) utilize GitHub secrets (e.g., `secrets.IONOS_API_KEY`, `secrets.IONOS_SSH_KEY`). This is a best practice for handling sensitive data in CI/CD.
*   **Node.js Server:** For the Node.js server, environment variables should be used for any sensitive configuration (API keys, database credentials, etc.) when deployed. How these are set on IONOS is not detailed in the workflows but is a standard best practice.

## Summary & Recommendations

The project has a foundational `SECURITY.md` policy. Implemented measures include data sanitization in server-side logging and the use of GitHub Secrets in CI/CD. HTTPS is expected at the hosting level.

**Key Areas for Attention/Verification:**

*   **`.htaccess` Discrepancy:** Clarify if the current simple `.htaccess` is intended or if a version with security headers (CSP, XSS, etc.) should be in place, especially if an Apache server is involved in serving content at any stage (though IONOS Deploy Now might make this less relevant if it uses Nginx or other servers).
*   **Implementation of Stated Policies:** Review how measures like CSP, XSS protection, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and automated security scanning (beyond default GitHub checks) are handled â€“ whether at the IONOS platform level or if they need to be implemented in the application/web server configuration.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Establish a regular process or enable automated tools (like Dependabot) for checking and updating Node.js dependencies.
*   **Server-Side Input Sanitization:** While logging sanitizes data, ensure any user inputs directly processed by the Node.js server (if it handles forms/APIs) are also rigorously sanitized to prevent XSS, NoSQL injection, etc.
