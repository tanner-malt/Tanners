# Life
So working on so many projects is quite hard. I also decided to play through some games I have, my goal is to 100% factorio, then satisfactory. My attention span is limited, and I feel the nights that my sleep schedule gets distored, and my diet is worse. Regardless, I'll keep trying to keep it all together. 


# Programming
I'll be the first to admit, I don't really know how git works. I'm running into an issue where my file size is too big from "historical_data.csv", i did a quick lil git rm on it, added *.csv to my .gitignore, and still it didnt work. 

My solution at this point is to make a new project, but im still not sure why *.csv didnt work. I also messed up my git control, which was user error, a lot went wrong and its on me. this has been the primary reason for lack of motivation.

I'm also now including the below percentages to show my actual progress. 

Going to keep the below as a running list
Re-doing
1. Population Simulator (0%)
2. AI Assistant (0%)
3. Budget Tracker (0%)
4. Tax Calculator (0%)

Making
1. Coinbase Trading Bot (Re-doing some of the features already done; 40% done) 
2. Time Value of Money Simulation (Paper and Analysis as well) (0%)
3. Video Game (To be titled and described later?) (10%)
4. Minecraft Bot (To track Pricing Data) (80%)
5. Calculator (5%)

# Diet
I find it unlikely to hit my goal this month, 2 trips and the stumble at the start is not a good way to go, regardless of the excuses i made some progress at least, and started working out, but im hesitant to attribute the muscle weight gain to why i missed my mark.


| Month    | Weight (ending) |
| -------- | ------- |
| December  | 260    |
| January | 256     |
| Febuary (In Progress)    | 254    |
| March (Hopeful)    | 239    |

we lost 2 pound since last time. I am at my lowest this month, and 8 from my goal for this month.

# Learning Objectives
I learned how to use a generator function with the yield keyword, the only use case i found for it so far is to search a database without creating a list, but i will be on the lookout for other areas i can use this on.

# Modern Events

So, the biggest issue with DOGE, is Elon is bad at math. Hindsight is 20/20, I just wish he had done more fine tooth work, instead of these broad misses. I think this has been a failed experiment, and while there's still room to say im wrong, I think he's already back pedalled heavily.
