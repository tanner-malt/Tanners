After the long task of trouble shooting, the climactic ending was with error 403 forbidden, I was confused because the documentation didn't mention needing an ".htaccess" page, I'm a novice and I overlooked this thinking there was some issue with a config file, with the git repository (i ended up rebuilding it 3 times from scratch), or with the web host's configuration where i needed to check some setting or tweak distribution. 

The bright side is I got to learn a lot about git actions, and structure of a static web page, not overlooking the complete frustration of trying to fix something when I needed to add a file, i can take a few valuable insights from this.

1. the deployment folder is from the generated public folder, i dug around a lot looking for index.html files that were not working.
2. checking for errors is not easy, and should be done with abundance of time and focus, looking at the specific issue at hand, it could even be useful to chart out the issue if its confusing enough 
3. i learned what a static website is! this might be obvious to some, but trying to get into web development space and learning what the variety of terms is! Definitly something I want to track progress on!
