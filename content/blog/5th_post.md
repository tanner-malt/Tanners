# Life 

Well, blogging daily lasted 0 days, I quickly found myself immersed in a busy schedule, and while i like making remarks and posting to the oblivion, I had a lot of things I got done, over these last few days I got a lot of things off my list of things done. 

It's surprising to me, I see life in a new way. Since turning 26, I see things differently I suppose. Realizing how little I've done so far, it's all been studying, and for what? I can barely recall the things I used to pour hours into looking into, why haven't I made projects sooner?

I mean given some areas of leniency, my robot ambitions were mostly brought down with funding issues. I had $2500 and looking at the energy requirements was bsaically telling me I didn't have even half enough to make a prototype. Big bummer.

I've been world building a fantasy world for years. Since my second year in college, I have started story after story throughout the years, but never got far. I felt my writing was bad, I felt like the story points were bad. I felt like I was bad. I felt embarassed for coming up with these narratives, (still do a little, I might keep up blogging to burry this part!), but now I'm 30 pages deep, in a story I've fallen in love with. 

One day I want to have an IP of my own, I want to bring my fantasy and my world to as many people as I can, TV, movies, games, books, conventions, whatever I can do I'll try and do. But for now I'll handle it one page at a time. 

I think one thing that helps me, is i'm writing a fantasy story about things that have actually happened. Maybe not in reality, but I play these scenes out in my head, I watch them exist, I see their flaws, I see their struggles, I can see them doing what they can. I'm really enjoying it, and I was orginally planning a 200 page book, but I don't see how I can keep it that short; I'm thinking maybe 400 at this point.

# Programming

I wanna also talk about my programming skills, I feel like I'm at a level thats good for once in my life, I need to finalize some projects I'm working on but soon I hope I can take my skills to a non profit, and offer my services. I'm hoping I can do data science contracting as a side piece to my normal income.

# Diet

I really like Huel! I am drinking my last of 48, I got the package 1/23, so I basically had two weeks to drink 48 of these, I drank a little more than 3 a day, and the results are showing.

| Month    | Weight (ending) |
| -------- | ------- |
| December  | 260    |
| January | 256     |
| Febuary (In Progress)    | 253    |
| March (Hopeful)    | 239    |

I seem to have gained a pound since I last weighed, but i had some intense cheat days trying to stretch out my supply... and to enjoy the foods I was missing, but I'm doubling down and ordering 96 in the next shipment. I tried chocolate and strawberry banana, strawberry banana was a heavy favorite, but chocolate was good. 

Gonna do 2 variety packs to try and get some more flavors in rotation.

# Learning Objectives

Learning has been a little difficult, I don't think I actually learned anything, but I refined some skills so lets include that!

Containers are more complex and easier than I thought. I'm getting ready to deploy my coinbase investment project that will auotmate a lot of trades for me, i need to sit down really learn what a container is and how to deploy it, but im excited, maybe in two - three weeks i can have something cool to talk about here. I learned a lot as it is in setting up a repo and making myself look profesional. 

# Modern Events

Of course, the president of the United States is Donald Trump, I think anyone with senitience can recall his last term, the stories around the world almost always had him as a tagline.

I don't like or dislike him, but one thing is the double edged sword of Elon and DOGE. I think its dangerous to let someone like Elon into the government books, but I think someone should do it, I think it should be more transparent at the very least. 

Some of the things they have brought to light are completely baffling, I understand why the US must support foreign nations, but the extent is.. concerning. the corruption in the system is concerning.
