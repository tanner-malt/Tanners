## Chances to learn

I've been working on filling out this site with more and more information, I think its not too much of a commitment if I say do a post a day, or add something to my library or exapnd on *something* every day, last time I worked on the site I discovered a neet trick to add a table, and urls, combining those two and I get a nice little table of contents without needing to comprimise my sites main menu. Today's goal is going to add another section, and to add some content as well as table of contents, I think linking "back" buttons with urls to the last page visited could help add some more functionality, and if i want to keep expanding my site, it'll be useful.

Other than that I wanted to fill in on my diet, im currently down 13 pounds, yippie
