# Life
I have a sort of template I can use now to make these, which makes it a lot easier. So what's new? I got to go rock climbing yesterday, and didn't hurt myself! my weight has made it very difficult to do fun active things, and while i have been working out, and dieting to help fix this, it's nice to do some low effort activities.

I also settled on a template for a video game I had started on a few months back. It's mostly in google docs in planning phases right now, but im hoping by this weekend I can have a working prototype with barebone features? Basically just an idle game would release on steam, and consider IOS launch as well, but mobile game marketplace seems overly hard and requiring a lot of marketing... im not super interested in monetizing my work so doing something for financial gain doesn't seem all that great.


# Programming
I've been working on more math based ideas than programming, the only thing to note is I made some progress connecting to coinbase API and starting to collect data. Props to my boy max who helped me understand how APIs work, (it sent back an object that looked like json, and i was trying to load it into a dataframe as if it was a json file)

Now I also know dir() and type(), which I will include in my learning section below.

For actual programming, my goal is to calculate the first derivative and find tangets = 0 in candle graph, to do this I need to work out a way to interpolate between each candle; not impossible and it should be fairly easy once I can sit down for a few hours and figure that out.

# Diet

So my diet was not good over the weekend without Huel. I got my shipment today, so dinner moving forward is back on diet! Below is the table. Max recommended I could probably do this graphically as well

| Month    | Weight (ending) |
| -------- | ------- |
| December  | 260    |
| January | 256     |
| Febuary (In Progress)    | 254    |
| March (Hopeful)    | 239    |

we gained 1 pound since last time.

# Learning Objectives

So one thing I realized while working on trying to containize my project, is i have no idea why im trying to do that already. It seems to make more sense to build the app, then put it into a container. this might be flawed thinking, but learning this process was taking time from developing, and for the record I want to deploy this as my priority number 1. Earlier I mentioned I don't want to monetize my work, but thats because I want all of my wealth to be generated from investments, ie this money bot. 

So let me explain the big use I found for dir and type,

type was used to confirm that the information the API was sending, was not JSON. It was actually amazing to me, I had sat with that on my plate for about a day, trying to sort out ways to get the information, I still need to properly parse it, but now I can do it within the object instead of through dozens of lines of code (I had a way to load the data into a dataframe, but i didnt have a way to get the info inside, so basically i knew how many candles there were, and that was it).

dir was used to tell what the functions we could use on the object were, i remember learning both of these lessons at one point, but i didn't get a chance to use them in a project, and well here we are now. 

# Modern Events
I think the thing I need to talk about the most is the DOGE situation still, and the Deepseek. 

The amount of corruption that had gone on within the US government is scary. Plain and simple. I will not say Elon is a good person, I quite dislike him, but the thing he is doing is amazing. I'm not concerned with the private information he is getting access to; note his paypal days he had similiar info.

I am scared of what he has uncovered in less than a month. The waste, corruption, and the backlash he faced for doing it? thats the confusing part.

I more than likely will not get social security. as terrible as that reality is, its where we live now. the funds for social security are being sent off to who knows where, and im happy to see someone made accountable
