# Life
Going to DC this weekend! Friend mickey wanted to go see some of his friends there, and asked me to tag along, I haven't gone since I was 13, so I'm excited to go.

Wanted to add the following to my food library, going to try and mark what i eat on the daily.

For the record, todays menu is banana huel, some beef jerkey, salted carmel huel, strawberry banana huel, and we will see a flavor when we get home. will probably drink one and a half tonight. I also started refrigerating drinks before having them, and its added a lot of flabor

Little Ceasars deep dish pizza (2770 calories)
Little Ceasars bacon & cheese crazy Puffs (700 calories)
Subway Order (1200 calories)
Banana Huel (400 calories)
Salted Caramel Huel (400 Calories)

Other than that, not much going on. Struggling to keep my sleep schedule somewhat normal.


# Programming
Again, most of my work has been more focused on math, but I can talk about some of the algorthims here and how I'm attempting to create them.

So the biggest issue in financial marketing predictions is risk management, otherwise we could 1000000000x leverage and make infinity money. The market I'm looking at specifically coinbase crypto futures, and with the variance in crypto being 10-20% on a day, this is exceptionally hard. 

Of course we know the general trend from history is just going up, but my current approach is looking at positions as a month long adventure, and attempting to ration out funds for the entire month in advance. If I use a price predictor and find a normal probability that we are going to go from 100 to 110 by the end of the month, ill go in at 100 with 10% of my cash, and if we drop to 90, i buy with 10% more, if we go to 80, 10% more, if I go to 70, 10% more. Then when we hit 100 again, we can cash out all these lower positions, but maybe only cash out 7% of the position, since we are expecting to go to 110, we can use it as a lower cost basis and profit more at 110.

# Learning Objectives
This was all about math math math, when i complete my notes ill go ahead and add them here. 

# Modern Events

A lot of news, crypto being a scam is not surprising. I still think bitcoin is, but you can make money there. A lot of these other projects are just rug pulls, through and through.
