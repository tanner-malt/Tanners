# Life
Another big two weeks of no updates, it's been hard to keep these things posted... I think event based is better than periodic, and so I'll be moving to event based posting from now on, then maybe i wont feel so bad about not posting. 

To be honest, I've been suffering from general sadness at how fast life moves. the monotonity of daily life settled in pretty heavily. I feel more like an adult than ever, and that scares me to be honest, oh the whimsy of being a child with few responsibilities. Now I look at stock market crash and think what can I do, while funny its also depressing. 

Almost as depressing, I died in my factorio hardcore save. I know I know, 75 hours of gameplay gone, but I wasn't even that far. I'm on a new save now, and struggling to optimize the space platform, part of my issue was that I got trapped on an alien planet, because my ship couldn't stand the orbital preasure. Goal is to create a robust ship that can act as a main transport for the duration of the game, but I'm struggling with resource processing, I wonder if there's a way to change astroid collection filters based on what's on the belt? I'm terrible at circuits so this is a good chance to learn.


# Programming
I spent some time programming lately at least, I worked on a few practice problems, and finished up my minecraft bot. Next steps is a work project I started to read a PDF and use it to create a dbml schematic for visual inspection. Goal with this is to get some data clarity in my company's orginization. 

Going to keep the below as a running list
Re-doing
1. Population Simulator (0%)
2. AI Assistant (0%)
3. Budget Tracker (0%)

Making
1. Coinbase Trading Bot (Re-doing some of the features already done; 40% done) 
2. Time Value of Money Simulation (Paper and Analysis as well) (0%)
3. Video Game (To be titled and described later?) (50%)
4. Minecraft Bot (To track Pricing Data) (Finished!)
5. Calculator (5%)

# Fitness
I've felt terrible lately. my poor fitness has been a big reason to not update, but im at a whooping 257, with almost a full month lead on my huels. I need to re-evaluate if I need this many.

| January | 256     |
| Febuary   | 252   |
| March (Goal)  | 256   |
| April (Current)    | 257    |
| April (Goal)    | 242    |
| May (Goal)    | 236    |
| June (Goal)    | 228    |


# Learning Objectives
Well, one of the items I spent some learning time on was generative AI. I learned how to use the new 2.0 gemini capabilities via a 5 day webinar from Kaggle. I mentioned before about a dbml schematic, and that is my planned capstone project for the webinar.

To be honest, I didn't learn much more than it's exististence and some use cases, the unfortunate thing is that hallucinations are still a big problem, so you dont want to use this technology on many things that can be critical. 

Additionally, I learned how to tween in godot, and I got a little better at rummaging through files. Being so focused on "best practices" has been killer lol. From now on I'm planning to do things as I see fit, and just jump into problems with whatever planning I can come up with, and go from there.

# Modern Events
Last time I posted Tesla was getting hammered. Now we have tariffs. I'm waiting for initial stock market reaction to post this, but I'm exicitied to see how the market reacts.

Well, I'm about 7 minutes post open, looks like we're in a recession.
