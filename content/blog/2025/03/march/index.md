# Life
Had a pretty good weekend, and my factorio base is coming along wonderfully, I'm planning to make some changes to clean up my library (in the website) next week, it could definitly use some more clarity and better navigation.


# Programming
I decided to take a small break from the trading bot, the economy outlook isn't super stable and I'd feel more comftorable doing it during bull markets. That being said, I also thought I should drop the tax calculator.

I worked on video game a bit, still no title, its just an idle clicker.

Going to keep the below as a running list
Re-doing
1. Population Simulator (0%)
2. AI Assistant (0%)
3. Budget Tracker (0%)
4. Tax Calculator (Dropping- Much better out there and this is fairly complicated)

Making
1. Coinbase Trading Bot (Re-doing some of the features already done; 40% done) 
2. Time Value of Money Simulation (Paper and Analysis as well) (0%)
3. Video Game (To be titled and described later?) (20%)
4. Minecraft Bot (To track Pricing Data) (80%)
5. Calculator (5%)

# Diet
I was correct about not hitting my goal, I did get down to 252 so it wasn't a total loss! Any progress is progress, but I am hoping to get out of this rut soon.


| Month    | Weight (ending) |
| -------- | ------- |
| December  | 260    |
| January | 256     |
| Febuary   | 252   |
| March (In Progress)  | 250   |
| April (Hopeful)    | 228    |

we lost 2 pound since last time. Start of this month at 250, goal is 239 for the end of this month so I am 11 away

# Learning Objectives
Okay so this is a mostly godot section, what have I learned. 

Linking nodes to scripts
creating functions 
using emmitters

# Modern Events
I actually dont really know how to start, I think the implemented tariffs are stupid, and the trade war is not going to be good.
