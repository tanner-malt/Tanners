# Life
Okay wow, 16 days later so much for daily posts LOL, whats happened since last time.

I think from a life perspective, last week I went rock climbing again, and had a work outing which completely exhausted me from doing almost anything, I also discovered my cologne makes me sick! Well I think thats what caused it, google tells me to try a natural-based fragerence. 

I also started contacting non-profits to offer pro bono services, I'm excited for the oppertunity to help people, I think I have a good chance to be helpful, while further building my skill set.


# Programming
I got a lot further on my game, I think now I just need graphics, and data added, out of the projects, in my exhausted state I decided to go with the "fun" one

Going to keep the below as a running list
Re-doing
1. Population Simulator (0%)
2. AI Assistant (0%)
3. Budget Tracker (0%)

Making
1. Coinbase Trading Bot (Re-doing some of the features already done; 40% done) 
2. Time Value of Money Simulation (Paper and Analysis as well) (0%)
3. Video Game (To be titled and described later?) (50%)
4. Minecraft Bot (To track Pricing Data) (80%)
5. Calculator (5%)

# Fitness
Hahahaha, a lot changes in 2 weeks, not for the better. the work outing and my lack of discipline really killed me these last two weeks. I think It's time I re-evaluate my goal so I can have more realisitic. This still puts me as an overweight individual, but 12.5 pounds is just not realisitic. The Huels also are wearing off on their "magic", the solution is more refined diet, incorporating more fruits/veggies, and much more protein.

Also changing this to "Fitness"

I wanna talk about my workouts, just for a pacing guide, currently I have 35 pound dumbells and thats my max.

# Learning Objectives
I need to do these more often, the knowledge is forever lost. 

# Modern Events
TESLA getting hammered, and I feel really bad for anyone that owns a tesla, but I also see some of the outrage. I think violence is definitly a step too far, where are the peaceful protests?
