It's already December. I'm actually surprised how quick this year flew by, it's always interesting to see how time flies. I'm a year in almost with my blogging, and it's astounding how much I learned and grew over the last year, It's hard to articulate how I've grown. 

I feel confident programming. 
I no longer feel the dread of AI taking over. 
My language learning goals have progressed well.
My body transformation lacked, I am actually doing better than I was last year but I did not meet my goal.

I lost two more factorio hardcore worlds this week.

Some things never change. Looking back at some of the content I posted last year I might remove them off the website, but leave them in the git trail, it seems somewhat fitting for an amuater, but I do not like some of the content I put out on the internet. Still it's memories, and helps me remember what my life was like during this time lol. 

Let's re-align, what will 2026 hold in store for me? 

I want to cement myself and the company I was working on, while finishing my Masters. I think I will maintain my current position at work, or be promoted. The goal is to get my own funding, and I think I want to sit on $25,000 + a house. I'm actively looking at apartments, and any oppertunity that might be good for me. If there's a good enough job I can sit back and learn a lot at, I would love to take that chance.

My skill set focused on learning programming, and I think my capstone project to end the year will be finalizing a trading bot, goal is to launch early January, though after doing considerable research I'm more and more aware of the difficulties of actually making money, I just want something that shows my progress as a programmer and this would integrate SQL, machine learning, CI/CD, and testing, all things I wanted to learn this year.

I do not feel depressed at all. Years of feeling down gone, progress is showing and I think we're headed where we need to be. 

Cheers to 2026, hopefully one of these years I can work on immortality cause my back hurts.
