# Life
So what's been new? Two week flies by when you're working hard. As a little bonus, I got to work on some software projects at work, which was beyond exciting, I think I might have gone overboard with my scope, but the way I see it, as long as it's still helpful, and works well it's good. 

Other than that on a more personal note, I've been going for many more walks, and rock climbing more! Small break right now because I hurt my arm, nothing major but need to give it time to heal to not make it worse. 

I'm also ready to start cold calling and setting up business appointments, and looking for a house! haha maybe this should be higher on the list of updates 

# Programming
This covers my personal projects pretty well, in addition I made my first software application for multiple users, using tkinter and excel files, its meant to be a placeholder for an eventual migration over to a django framework with SQL, but I needed to make a proof of concept. 

Other than that, I did some work on my AI assistant, mostly setting up the agent scheme, im not super happy with it, and likely will re-write, but i need to declare the scope.
