# Life

4 months have gone by in the blink of an eye. Looking back at my past blogs, I don't even know where I'm at comparably, so I'm going to somewhat start anew here. 

I have been in a great place mentally, I'm currently attending Harvard Extension School for my Masters, it's in liberal arts, and I am really thinking about a PhD at some point. 

A lot of my projects have flown out, as I try to focus on more specifically what I want to do, and get something done. My programming as a hobby retracted, my writing time retracted, and at work I spent significantly more time writing programs to automate, analyze, and improve quality of life. At home I've mostly been relaxing, while also trying to catch up on health.

Now I'm almost finished with my health jounrey, and getting ready to fully launch my company! I'm very excited at the thought of being able to put my skills to work.

# Programming
Wow the programming burnout is real! As I said in the last section I spent a lot more time programming at work, and my time here has gone out the door, a lot of these projects i barely recognize, and haven't been considered/looked at since the last blog post.

Finished
1. Excel mass updater
2. maltifect website core
3. Report builder (Stich multiple graphs and data analytics onto a single pdf)

Re-doing
1. Population Simulator (0%)
2. Budget Tracker (0%)

Making
1. Coinbase Trading Bot (10% I went back and really want to analyze how I do this) 
2. Time Value of Money Simulation (Paper and Analysis as well) (0%)
3. Video Game (To be titled and described later?) (50%)
4. Video Game 2 (75%)
5. AI SaaS (5% poc is done, need to actually make most of it)
6. maltifect website demos (5% I put down what I want, I just need to throw the demos togther)

# Health

I have a lot here, first I had a little trip to the ER and had a long time medical condition diagnosed, which is good and bad. good because I can start being healthier and making more informed decisions, bad because hospitals are expensive as it turns out!

Anyways, my weight has remained fairly constant in the 250's, much better than the 260's, but my goal is still 180. I'm also coming off of succesive injuries that prevented me from doing as much physical activity as I would have wanted, and starting to workout again, I'm on good pace for Q4 to finish the year strong.

My mental health is at peaks I've not seen though, I'm happier than ever, and content with my current lot in life, and also looking forward to the future. 

I also started doing some more advanced skincare and styling, I decided my go to haircut will be a mid fade, with long on top, trying to square out the bottom with a beard, and some extensive products. I have supplments in Biotin, Probiotics, Zinc, D3+K2 (these taste the best btw), C3? I think I'd have to check but whatever helps with skin, and also an immune health one, i forget which vitamin.

My skin care routine has toners, serums, eye cream, body lotion, cleasner, exfoliant, etc etc, i write to show the extent, I might make more in depth content later on though.
