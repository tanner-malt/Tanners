# Learning Objectives
Honestly I read automate the boring stuff, and I learned so much it's hard to really tell exactly what is relevenat. Logging I think is the biggest game changer, I always was a little afraid of it, but now I know how to do it, and feel confident in my ability to use it in the future. 


# Modern Events
Trade war!!!! At this point everyones sick of it that I know. I get the idea of helping bussinesses out compete china, but this is just too much.
