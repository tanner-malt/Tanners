So far 2026 has treated me well, but again it has gone by far too quickly.

I was accepted into Grad School, which I suppose is a good highlight.

I am now down 20 pounds consitently.

I am insanely good at rock climbing

I am Diamond I in League of Legends

I finished a webscape program to pull data off the mcd website.

That is all, thank you.
