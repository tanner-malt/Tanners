I've been thinking a lot about how I want my life to go, and what my goals are, and of course how limited time is.

The question of "what is the meaning of life" is a little more deep and philosophical than I care to say, to summarize my feelings on this are each person defines how they want to live life, and I do not believe in a higher power guiding us along.

So my goals:
1. Critical: Biologically extend human life, cybernetics could be an alternative but I would prefer biological to remain "human"
2. Possible Difficult: Become the first Quadrillionaire
3. Establish respectable companies that solve world problems and progress the status quo, ie robotics, intelligent usage of AI, space travel (not how fakelon musk is doing)


So I've been dedicating a considerable effort on shipping my first app, the most challenging aspect is the constant security concerns; I'm using AI guided assistance as I code since I'm not a very experienced frontend developer, and I'm not sure the best way to vet for security holes other than doing some old-fashioned human research on it. 

School going well, but it's weird yesterdays lecture the guy talked for 2 hours straight; no questions; no breaks. He ended at exactly 2 hours as well, immaculate timing.
