# Life

Having a somewhat lazy week. Getting back into drinking huel again has led to some minor struggles. 

Fast food is truly *poison*. 

I didn't realize it until I stopped eating it, then started again. Its led to being much much less productive, as well as another valentine alone. I think I can exucse myself for skipping some things. Biggest thing is discipline. 

I think the most vital thing to have when trying to do anything is discipline. This goes for everything that comes to mind, with the only exception being luck. 

I'm also adding a Life section to my library, I'll be adding things I have in my blog into those sections, notably foods I like, games I enjoy, things like that. Just more info about me, and things for me to remember. So many times I'll try a restaurant once, then a year later forget if I like the food or not, as a picky eater having a way to check would be beneficial! I'll also keep my weight tracked there,

# Diet

For the record, I didn't get my Huel until 2/12/24. I had a lot of chicken, and tried to have fruit, mostly through fruit cups. Not sure how effective that is, but I'm ready to start focusing on my diet again. 

| Month    | Weight (ending) |
| -------- | ------- |
| December  | 260    |
| January | 256     |
| Febuary (In Progress)    | 253    |
| March (Hopeful)    | 239    |

we lost 1 pound since last time. I am 1 pound from my lowest this month, and 9 from my goal for this month.

# Learning Objectives

This one is a little cheap, I saw this in my github feed, https://github.com/simonw/python-lib-template-repository/tree/main/.github/workflows this should help me set up projects, 

# Modern Events

MEGA movement is starting in full swing it seems. This is pretty absurd to me, but I see the reaction to immigration. There are a lot of violent crimes commited. I'm not sure how I feel about it all just yet.
