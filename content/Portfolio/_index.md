## Tanner's Portfolio

This is my Portfolio, where I will attempt to cover majority of projects I have finished, embarassingly it was only the last 2 months I had a strong enough understanding of git to create repo's by myself, and by extension a lot of projects I lost due to not having good github documentation. I'll be attempting to fix some of my older repos that I was able to initialize, but didn't get to properly build out.

Below will be a list of links detailing each project I worked on, or at least notes for them if it's a school project... espcailly for my schoolwork I might be missing some code.
