Welcome to my portfolio. This is where I document the kinds of problems Iâ€™ve solved â€” and the kind of work Iâ€™m excited to take on.

Each card below represents something Iâ€™ve built, refined, or helped others understand. Whether itâ€™s forecasting revenue, designing dashboards, or scripting tools to replace tedious tasks â€” I aim to deliver **real-world results**, not just fancy code.

If youâ€™re a small business owner, freelancer, or just someone stuck under too many spreadsheets â€” letâ€™s talk.
