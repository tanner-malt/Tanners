## What I'm Working On Right Now

I'm juggling several exciting projects while pursuing my bigger vision of building meaningful technology. Here's where my energy is focused:

### Current Projects

**Consulting Venture** - Getting my first consulting gig off the ground. This is my primary focus right now. Building a business around my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. I've done a few quotes now, trying to price somewhat on the higher end, but I think I will have to bring cost down to bring in business.

**First Production App** - Building and shipping my first full-stack application with security as a core concern.

**Godot Game Development** - Progressing on a personal game project. This is a passion project that keeps the creative side sharp. I'm a little burnt on the boring parts for me, such as the art, but I'll jump on it again soon I think

**This Website** - Continuously improving my personal brand and digital presence with better SEO, design, and content.

### Learning & Research

- **System Design Fundamentals** - Diving deep into logging systems, monitoring, and observability. These are less about flashy features and more about building robust, professional-grade systems.
- **Advanced ML Models** - Exploring newer architectures and training methodologies
- **Security Best Practices** - Focused on building secure applications from the ground up

### Personal Goals

- Continue maintaining fitness progress (down 20 lbs and counting!)
- Get better at snowboarding (it's humbling)
- More rock climbing and hiking outdoors
- Build credibility in the consulting space
