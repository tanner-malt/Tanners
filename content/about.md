You might be wondering, what is this webpage for?

Put simply, this is my website where I will do some blogging, I'll be going over things I find interesting, learned, want to learn, or anything else that catches my attention.

Now that you know what this is, who am I?

My name is Tanner, I'm 26 years old, and I graduated from the University of Akron in 2022. I currently work as a Cost Analyst, where I estimate the cost to make wire harnesses, and outside of work I'm a gamer and outdoors person. Learning to snowboard (not going well), and wanting to get more into rock climbing and hiking! 

I played semi-profesional league of legends throughout college, my biggest acomplishments in the "esports" space are becoming a caster for my university's varsity team, I had the chance to work with a production team to live stream our games, build overlays, and some sound engineering. to be honest in this field I was more of a participant than a driver, I spent most of my time casting games, doing interviews, or preping stat sheets to talk about during the games. Additionally, I had multiple executive roles within the club space over the duration of 4 years [Head of Broadcasting, Vice President (to League), President (to League), Coach of the league teams, Team Manager, and Team Captain], and got to help form events, the highlight being raising $4,000 for a charity event to Akron's Childrens Hospital!

From more of a competatitor stand point, I made playoffs every season I played, making deep playoff runs 6 out of the 8 seasons, the highlight of my time was to be a stage game played at a venue in front of a live audience in front of dozens of people! unfortunately due to covid those plans were canceled... Aside from that I got the chance to play in multiple tournaments, the highlight here was playing against former LCS rookie of the year mike yeuong, who only a few years prior had been my favorite pro player to watch! We didn't do so well that game, but it's still one of my favorite stories to tell people!
