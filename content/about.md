## Who Am I?

My name is Tanner McGrath. I'm 26 years old, a developer, aspiring engineer, and someone deeply passionate about building technology that matters. I graduated from the University of Akron in 2022 and I'm currently pursuing a graduate degree at Harvard's School of Continuing Education.

Outside of coding, I'm an avid gamer and outdoors enthusiast. You'll find me rock climbing, hiking, or doing anything else that seems fun.

## Background & Education

I graduated from the University of Akron in 2022 and just got accepted to graduate school in 2026, which I'm incredibly excited about. During my time at university, I juggled full-time studies with competitive gaming, leadership roles, and entrepreneurial pursuits.

My undergraduate degree was in Applied Mathematics, and I spent a lot of time focusing on data and machine learning classes. My highest math class was Advanced Calculus II, and I learned I do not enjoy doing proofs! I think my biggest regret was not taking more of the engineering tangent classes. I really like the math side of engineering and the problem-solving, but I was pushed away from it due to the 3D design aspect (I am not even close to being an artist and I struggle to make real-world representations).

For my Master's, I wanted to focus on connecting the dots. I have a lot of skills, but often I find myself struggling in real-world scenarios. Over the last year, I have gotten very good at applying what I learned, but my goal is to be able to do anything within an engineering/software wheelhouse; I believe that will unlock my ability to do anything I want.

## Professional & Current Focus

I currently work as a Cost Analyst while pursuing my bigger vision: building technology that solves real problems and advances humanity. My focus is shifting toward consulting and entrepreneurship, where I can apply my technical skills and creative problem-solving to meaningful projects.

## What Drives Me

To me, humanity is largely stagnant. We have so many technologies that are unexplored. I want to update the structures around us to be more in line with what you would expect.
