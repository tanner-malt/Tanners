## How to get started Programming?

First let me get started and make no assumption, I am not a software engineer, but I have expierence coding and programming dating back to my days in university. I came to the conclusion that programming as taught in school is a terrible expierence, and this is what partially prompted me to create my library, I want to help anyone learn how to program. 

Before you ever step into programming, let me also clarify; anyone can make a program. We live in an era where you can prompt artificial intelligence, and it will magically spit out a bunch of lines of text that claim they solve your problem. a few things,

1. this code is servicable but does not always have the best solution for your project, we will go into this later, but its not a perfect solution. 
2. sometimes there are bugs, and lots of bugs in the program, if you lack the foundation you will not be able to debug and address them
3. Scaling and sophisitication can be lacking, keep in mind these AI are not at the level of creating new things yet, they are simply doing what they have seen elsewhere on the internet. 

At the end of the day the best way to learn to program is to read a LOT, and to practice. This is something that is on the level of learning a new language, and while some of it is very intuitive, there's often multiple ways to approach a problem, knowing the best for your project takes a lot of time and expierence, and remember, nothing is impossible in programming. with enough resources, you can do ANYTHING


With that out of the way, how do you actually get started? I'm going to make some recommendations, and since you're reading this, you're going to trust me. We will be using Python to drive our programming efforts, your first goal is to do NOTHING, do not open anything tab and start looking , do not go off and open youtube, this is your first lesson and it's patience. There are no shortcuts. 

In the spirit of not using shortcuts, this is going to mean the reader is gonna have to do a lot of work on their own, with minimal guidance here, use this as a framework as opposed to a follow along.

First thing, figure out how to install python. I can link it, but that won't help you, you'll need to do a lot of research on your own in this, so get to it. Please make sure to not download any viruses. 

Next, make sure you downloaded it correctly, the simplest way is to open a search window and type in python, this should open a terminal that looks like command prompt (if you dont know what either of those are, google them), and it should should the version you're using, and some other stuff we won't worry about, feel free to type in help() into the terminal and type enter.

If that worked, great! you just used a function and a python terminal for the first time, if that didn't work, as bad of advice as it sounds, start trouble shooting why, you might need to look around a bit, but you'll get it.

This is the basics of programming, and you now have a link to Python's tutorial, this help command throws a LOT of text directly at you, so just ignore it, open up a google doc, or go get a notebook, now is your time to start taking notes, store that link it's filled with information we will love later on, but for now this is a good stopping point.
