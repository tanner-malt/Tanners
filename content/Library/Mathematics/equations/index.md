## Introduction

Thinking about where I wanted to start was a little difficult. This is the first "advanced" math topic I think anyone learns. I still remember middle school being taught x + 1 = y, and how this simple equation opened the world of math forever.


## x = y

Instead of talking about x + 1 = y, lets start even more basic and go over x = y, what does this mean? This is a convient time to show you function notation! for the uninitated, notation just means a symbol to show what something is, it's like an acronym for math, and function notation starts off very simple, all you need for it is f().

f() shows a function, and what exactly is a function? there are strict definitions math uses, and they can get complicated fast, all a function does is takes some value and turns it into another value, like a factory. to use our notation, we put a variable into the parenthesis, f(x) and this is now what the variable will turn into, x = y can be written as x = f(x), because the y value is determined by the x. 

now a variable might catch some readers off guard, what is a variable? it's something that varies! (great way to explain it!), but it's a placeholder for any value and is what makes a function useful. If I said 1 = 1 you might look at me strangly and say of course? well if I said 2 = 2 you'll be even more confused and say right again, and as we continue to increase numbers, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, 5 = 5, 6 = 6, you might say why are you counting like that? then we can go back and say 2 = 2, or perhaps we could skip and say 10 = 10, 30 = 30, 145 = 145, -2 = -2, it doesn't matter! 

This above part is how we solve the function x = f(x), whatever value we want, we put into x, and look at the result, so if we want to solve the function when x is equal to 1, which in function notation is f(1), we do (1) = f(1), which is 1! hooray our first function! Notice how the x in the f(x) turns into 1? that's just telling you what number the function is being solved for, the number there doesn't matter to solving the math problem.

## x + 1 = f(x)


Now lets go back and handle x + 1 = y, now we have to do some addition to find the value, lets go ahead and switch this to function notation first, so x is going to be what varies, and y is what we are solving, so x + 1 = 
f(x), now since this is our problem, we can put any number we want into x, lets look at what happens when x = 1, or f(1)

(1) + 1 = f(1), here we need to do some math, 1 + 1 = 2, so lets put that there, 2 = f(1), and thats the answer! simple right? since f(1) is what we are solving for, the answer is just 2, now lets try a few more values,

# Practice

f(3) , f(-2) , f(0) , f(0.5)

if you need to learn what an equation is write them all out fully, these should be easy problems, but getting the hang of doing the function process is vital

(3) + 1 = f(3) = 4
(-2) + 1 = f(-2) = -1
(0) + 1 = f(0) = 1
(0.5) + 1 = f(0.5) = 1.5

here's one nice thing about equations, as long as something is true you can say they equal, so (3) + 1 is the same thing as f(3) which is the same thing as 4, all of those result in the number 4! you can do math problems like this to watch your function transform when its harder problems, for example if we looked at 23x + 105x + x^3 = f(x), chances are you wont be able to get the answer in one step, and thats okay! math is about breaking things into small pieces so you can solve a problem!
